Tasks
0. Change your home IP
Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements.

Requirements:

localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.
The checker is running on Docker, so make sure to read this

1. Show attached IPs
Write a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine it’s executed on.

Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./1-show_attached_IPs | cat -e
10.0.2.15$
127.0.0.1$
sylvain@ubuntu$
Obviously, the IPs displayed may be different depending on which machine you are running the script on.

Note that we can see our localhost IP :)

2. Port listening on localhost
Write a Bash script that listens on port 98 on localhost.

Terminal 0

Starting my script.

sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo ./100-port_listening_on_localhost
Terminal 1

Connecting to localhost on port 98 using telnet and typing some text.
